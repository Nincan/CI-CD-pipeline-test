# Learning Spaceweb

We understand that learning new libraries have their own set of challenges.
To help you get started, we are here to help! First, you'll learn the concepts
of Spaceweb, then you'll build your first Spaceweb application.

## Concepts

### Overrides

Looking to customize Spaceweb components? There is a concept call overrides. Each Spaceweb component consists of multiple subcomponents (for example list can have list container and list items). Overrides gives you a full access to all those subcomponents and lets you to customize:

- styles of the subcomponent
- props of the subcomponent
- or replace it completely

Every Spaceweb component has a top-level prop called overrides. It accepts a map of subcomponents
and desired overrides.

_To learn more, check out the [Overrides guide](/guides/understanding-overrides/)._

### Controlled and Uncontrolled components

Most code examples you'll find on the documentation site feature controlled components.

> In HTML, form elements such as `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<select>` typically maintain their own
> state and update it based on user input. In React, mutable state is typically
> kept in the state property of components, and only updated with setState().

> We can combine the two by making the React state be the “single source of truth”.

Most Spaceweb components are released with both options:

- `Stateful` components, to support uncontrolled usage,
- and the default component, that supports controlled usage.

_To learn more about these, check out the official React docs on
[Controlled components](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components)
and [Uncontrolled components](https://reactjs.org/docs/uncontrolled-components.html)._

### Styling

Styling in **Spaceweb** is done using CSS-in-JS. Head over to [this link](/guides/styling) to learn everything about it.
