### Building Spaceweb Themes

The command `spaceweb theme` helps you to generate the utility classes and the theme tokens file. Whenever a theme config is changed you need to run this command in order to update the theme files.

Standard themes are stored at the package `packages/spaceweb-themes` under `src` directory.

Once Spaceweb CLI is installed globally, in order to build a theme you need to run the following command:

```
spaceweb theme [theme config file] [theme output dir]
```
