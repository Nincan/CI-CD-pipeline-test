# Payment Card

<Yard placeholderHeight={48} {...paymentCardYardConfig} />

The Payment Card input **automatically detects and formats credit card types**. It shows a small thumbnail icon of the parsed credit card brand to let users know they have entered their card in the correct format. The supported credit card brands are listed here:

<Table
  columns={['Card Type', 'Example Number']}
  data={[
    ['American Express', '378282246310005'],
    ['Diners Club', '36259600000004'],
    ['Discover', '6011111111111117'],
    ['ELO', '6550000000000001'],
    ['JCB', '3530111333300000'],
    ['Maestro', '6304000000000000'],
    ['Mastercard', '5555555555554444'],
    ['UnionPay', '6246729687894613'],
    ['Visa', '4111111111111111'],
  ]}
/>

The [card-validator](https://github.com/braintree/card-validator) library is used to determine the card format. It's also re-exported from `baseui/payment-card` as `valid` in case you need more metadata about the card.

This component is based on the [Input](/components/input) component. All of the props you can pass to `Input` also work on `PaymentCard`.

## Examples

<Example title="Basic usage" path="payment-card/examples/controlled.js">
  <Controlled />
</Example>
<Example title="Default value" path="payment-card/examples/defaultvalue.js">
  <DefaultValue />
</Example>

If you'd like to add further validations, check out the [card-validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/card-validator)
package that Base Web uses under the hood too.

### AutoFocus
`PaymentCard` accepts an `autoFocus` prop. For information on its behaviour, check <DocLink href="/components/input#autofocus">Input's autoFocus example</DocLink>.

<Example title="Stateful (uncontrolled) usage" path="payment-card/examples/uncontrolled.js">
  <Uncontrolled />
</Example>

As with many of our components, there is also an [uncontrolled](https://reactjs.org/docs/uncontrolled-components.html) version, `StatefulPaymentCard`, which manages its own state.
