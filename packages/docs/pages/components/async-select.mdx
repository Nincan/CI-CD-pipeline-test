# AsyncSelect

<Yard placeholderHeight={48} {...asyncSelectYardConfig} />

Use AsyncSelect component to load options from a remote source as the user types.

Options are fetched on the following triggers:

- When user enters some text in the input
- When user scrolls through the list of options in dropdown and all the pages of options haven't been fetched yet (pagination)
- On mount when `fetchOnMount` is `true`
- On focus (via keyboard or click) when `fetchOnFocus` is `true`

For more information, see the documentation of <DocLink href="/components/select">Select</DocLink>.

**Note:** By default, AsyncSelect looks for `id` and `label` properties in fetched options. To adapt to custom properties, use the `labelKey` and `valueKey` props to override the defaults.

## Examples

<Example title="Basic usage" path="async-select/examples/basic-usage.js">
  <BasicUsage />
</Example>

Things to note:

- `value` prop is always an `Array` to provide a consistent interface - no matter if you use multi or single select.
- `value` prop is an `Object[]`, wherein values corresponding to both - `labelKey` and `valueKey` are present. Since v11.4.0, <b>you can also pass `id[]` as value to AsyncSelect.
  `valueKeys` will also be present in `onChange` function from now on.</b>
- `options` returned by `loadOptions` prop is always an `Object[]`. Grouping of options is supported with GroupedAsyncSelect. Check next example.

<Example title="Basic Grouped usage" path="async-select/examples/basic-grouped-usage.js">
  <BasicGroupedUsage />
</Example>

Things to note:

- keys should be unique b/w group options

<Example title="Grouped Select with SelectAllOption" path="async-select/examples/grouped-select-all.js">
  <GroupedSelectAll />
</Example>

Things to note:

- Since exclude options is not supported yet, all groups will be collapsed and in disabled state when SelectAll is selected.
- Checked state of SelectAll option needs to be handled by consumer.
- Since, asyncSelect is not aware of all possible options, `valueKeys` and `value` will be an empty array for when onChange `type` is `selectAll`.

<Example title="Usage with minimum input" path="async-select/examples/usage-with-minimum-input.js">
  <UsageWithMinimumInput />
</Example>

Things to note:

- If `loadOnMount` is `true`, options will be fetched on mount irrespective of the value of `minimumInput`.
- If `loadOnFocus` is `true`, options will be fetched on focus only if the number of characters entered by user is equal to or exceeds `minimumInput` value.

<Example title="Usage with loadOnFocus" path="async-select/examples/with-load-on-focus.js">
  <WithLoadOnFocus />
</Example>
<Example title="Usage with prefetched options" path="async-select/examples/usage-with-prefetched-options.js">
  <UsageWithPrefetchedOptions />
</Example>
<Example
  title="Usage with resolved selected options"
  path="async-select/examples/usage-with-resolved-selected-options.js"
>
  <UsageWithResolvedSelectedOptions />
</Example>

Use when you have some preselected `value`s that don't need resolving (i.e. fetching of their corresponding options) by sending them as `initialOptions`.

Things to note:

- Options provided as `initialOptions` should always be a **subset** of all possible options that can returned from `loadOptions`
- `initialOptions` prop when present, is always an `Object[]`. Grouping of options is supported with GroupedAsyncSelect.
- Change in `initialOptions` on every render will not be honoured by `AsyncSelect`.

<Example
  title="Usage with unresolved selected options"
  path="async-select/examples/usage-with-unresolved-selected-options.js"
>
  <UsageWithUnresolvedSelectedOptions />
</Example>

Things to note:

- `value` prop is an `Object[]`, wherein values corresponding to both - `labelKey` and `valueKey` are present. Since v11.4.0, <b>you can also pass `id[]` as value to AsyncSelect.</b>
- `resolveSelectedOptions` prop will be invoked only **once** on first mount based on the presence of unresolved selected options with unresolved `valueKey`s.
- Use `resolveValuesOnUpdate`(introduced in 11.7.0) to calculate unresolved values and invoke `resolveSelectedOptions` on update as well.
- `options` returned by `resolveSelectedOptions` prop is always be an `Object[]`. Grouping of options is supported with GroupedAsyncSelect. Check next example.
- tombstone will be visible when initial selected options are being resolved.

<Example
  title="Usage with unresolved selected options grouped select"
  path="async-select/examples/usage-with-unresolved-grouped-selected-options.js"
>
  <UsageWithResolvedGroupedSelectedOptions />
</Example>

Things to note:

- `value` prop is an `{ [groupId]: Array<Object|id> }`. Object should have values corresponding to both - `labelKey` and `valueKey`.
- `options` returned by `resolveSelectedOptions` should be of shape `{ [groupId]: Array<Object|id> }`.
- tombstone will be visible when initial selected options are being resolved.

<Example title="Usage without search" path="async-select/examples/usage-without-search.js">
  <WithoutSearch />
</Example>

<Example title="Usage with createOption returning Promise" path="async-select/examples/create-option-promise.js">
  <CreateOptionPromise />
</Example>
